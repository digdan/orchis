# 🌸 Orchis – Complex Job Orchestration Template

**Orchis** is a powerful, flexible, and customizable job orchestration template to jump-start your background job workflows.  
Built with **JavaScript/Node.js**, it provides a structured foundation for defining, managing, and executing dependent jobs with ease.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Orchis provides a boilerplate structure for building robust job orchestration systems.  
With support for job definition, dependency handling, execution control, and orchestration patterns, it's ideal for complex workflows that need clarity, modularity, and scalability.

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean project structure with separate directories:
  - `recipes/` for workflow entrypoint
  - `flows/` for workflow definitions  
  - `jobs/` for individual job implementations  
  - `libs/` for shared utilities and helpers  
- Built-in examples and `.env` template for quick start  
- Orchestrator logic handled in `orchestrator.js`  
- Worker process defined via `worker.js`  
- Redis integration supported (via `redis.js`)  
- Clear entry point at `index.js`, powered by `package.json` scripts

````

- **recipes/**: Gather input, ordered sequences of flows with dependencies  
- **flows/**: Define ordered sequences of jobs with dependencies  
- **jobs/**: Encapsulate job logic—each job is self-contained  
- **orchestrator.js**: Reads workflows, orchestrates job execution, handles retries/errors  
- **worker.js**: Executes jobs, communicates with orchestrator, possibly via Redis  
- **redis.js**: Manages job state, communication, or persistence via Redis

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/digdan/orchis.git
   cd orchis
	```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**

   * Copy the example configuration:

     ```bash
     cp .env-example .env
     ```
   * Customize `.env` with required variables (e.g., Redis connection, orchestration options).

4. **Run the orchestrator & worker**

   ```bash
   node index.js recipes/my-sample-workflow.yaml
   ```

---

## 🛠 Usage

Define your jobs under `jobs/`, e.g., `jobs/sendEmail.js`, exporting a function that performs a job.
Configure flows in `flows/`, indicating order, parallelism, retries:

The orchestrator handles job dispatching and transitions.
The worker executes jobs and reports back.

---

## 📋 Example Workflow

1. **Define Jobs**

   * `jobs/fetchData.js`
   * `jobs/analyzeData.js`
   * `jobs/reportResults.js`

2. **Chain in a Flow**

```
name: MySampleFlow
jobs:
	downloadFile:
		job: fetchData
		dependsOn: []
	processData:
		job: analyzeData
		dependsOn: [downloadFile]
	sendEmail:
		job: reportResults
		dependsOn: [processData]
```


3. **Execution**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```
   fetchData → analyzeData → reportResults
   ```

---

## ⚙ Configuration

Orchis can be customized via `.env`, possibly including:

| Variable      | Description                   | Default     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `REDIS_URL`   | Redis connection string       | `redis://…` |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | Retry count per job           | `3`         |
| `LOG_LEVEL`   | Verbosity (e.g., info, debug) | `info`      |

---

## 🔧 Customization & Extension

* **Failure Handling**: Add retry logic in job implementations or orchestrator
* **Parallelism**: Extend orchestrator to support parallel branches
* **Persistence**: Store workflow metadata, job results, or state for auditing
* **Monitoring**: Integrate observability tools or dashboards for real-time tracking
* **Scaling**: Run multiple workers across machines; use Redis for synchronized state

---

## 💡 Best Practices

* Keep Jobs Modular: One responsibility per job file
* Descriptive Naming: Job names should clearly describe their action
* Idempotency: Design jobs to be safe if retried
* Logging: Include context-rich logs (flow name, job ID, parameters)
* Graceful Shutdowns: Ensure workers can exit cleanly, respecting ongoing jobs
